\f0\fs24 \cf0 Chained Conditionals:\
Chained conditionals involve a series of `if`, `elif`, and optionally `else` statements where each condition is evaluated one after the other, and the first true condition's block of code is executed. If none of the conditions are true, the `else` block (if present) is executed. Chained conditionals are used when you have multiple mutually exclusive conditions.\
\
Example:\
x = 10\
\
if x < 0:\
    print("x is negative")\
elif x == 0:\
    print("x is zero")\
else:\
    print("x is positive")\
\
Explanation:\
1. `x = 10`: This line assigns the value `10` to the variable `x`.\
2. `if x < 0:`: This is the first conditional statement. It checks if the value of `x` is less than `0`. In this case, `x` is `10`, which is not less than `0`, so this condition is `False`, and the code block under it is skipped.\
3. `elif x == 0:`: This is the second conditional statement, which uses `elif` (short for "else if"). It checks if the value of `x` is equal to `0`. Since `x` is `10`, which is not equal to `0`, this condition is also `False`, and the code block under it is skipped.\
4. `else:`: This is the default case for when none of the previous conditions are met. In this case, it means that `x` is greater than `0`. So, this block is executed.\
5. `print("x is positive")`: Inside the `else` block, this line prints the message "x is positive" to the console because the previous conditions were not satisfied.\
\
In this example, since `x` is `10`, the final message "x is positive" is printed because it falls into the `else` block. This code demonstrates how chained conditionals can be used to check multiple conditions in a specific order and execute the appropriate code block based on the first condition that is true.\
In this example, only one of the three branches will be executed based on the value of `x`.\
\
Nested Conditionals:\
Nested conditionals involve placing one conditional statement inside another. This is done when you need to check multiple conditions, and each condition may depend on the outcome of a previous condition.\
\
Example:\
x = 10\
\
if x > 0:\
    if x % 2 == 0:\
        print("x is positive and even")\
    else:\
        print("x is positive and odd")\
else:\
    print("x is not positive")\
\
Explanation:\
1. `x = 10`: This line assigns the value `10` to the variable `x`.\
2. `if x > 0:`: This is the outer conditional statement. It checks if the value of `x` is greater than `0`, which is true since `x` is `10`. As a result, the code block under this `if` statement is executed.\
3. Nested Conditional:\
   - `if x % 2 == 0:`: This is a nested conditional statement within the outer `if` block. It checks if the value of `x` is even. The condition `x % 2 == 0` calculates the remainder of `x` divided by `2`. Since `10` is divisible by `2` without a remainder, this condition is true, and the code block under it is executed.\
     - `print("x is positive and even")`: This line prints the message "x is positive and even" because both conditions (x > 0 and x is even) are met.\
4. The `else` block under the outer `if` statement is skipped because the conditions in the outer `if` block were met.\
5. The program concludes without executing any code under the `else` block because the outer `if` condition is satisfied.\
\
In this example, since `x` is `10`, the message "x is positive and even" is printed because it satisfies both conditions in the nested conditional statement. This code demonstrates how nested conditionals are used to perform more specific checks within a broader condition.\
\
Avoiding Nested Conditionals:\
To avoid deeply nested conditionals, you can use logical operators (`and`, `or`) to combine conditions and use a single level of indentation.\
\
Example:\
x = 10\
\
if x > 0 and x % 2 == 0:\
    print("x is positive and even")\
elif x > 0 and x % 2 != 0:\
    print("x is positive and odd")\
else:\
    print("x is not positive")\
\
Explanation:\
1. `x = 10`: This line assigns the value `10` to the variable `x`.\
2. `if x > 0 and x % 2 == 0:`: This is a single conditional statement with two conditions separated by the `and` logical operator:\
   - `x > 0`: This checks if `x` is greater than `0`, which is true since `x` is `10`.\
   - `x % 2 == 0`: This checks if `x` is even, which is also true because `10` is divisible by `2` without a remainder.\
   Since both conditions in the `if` statement are true, the code block under it is executed.\
   - `print("x is positive and even")`: This line prints the message "x is positive and even" because both conditions are met.\
3. The `elif` block is not executed because the conditions within it are not met. Since the code under the `if` block is executed, the program does not check the conditions in the `elif` block.\
4. The `else` block is also not executed because the conditions in the `if` block are met.\
\
In this example, the message "x is positive and even" is printed because the combined conditions in the `if` statement are satisfied. This code demonstrates how you can simplify nested conditionals by using logical operators to combine conditions and achieve the same outcome with improved readability.\
